\title{Posterior mean of K}
\description{
  Estimates the posterior mean of K as per equation 10 of KOH2001S,
  section 4.2
}
\usage{
EK.eqn10.supp(X.dist, D1, D2, H1, H2, d, hbar.fun,
   lower.theta, upper.theta, extractor, give.info=FALSE,
   include.prior=FALSE, phi, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{X.dist}{Probability distribution of \code{X}, in the form of a
    two-element list.  The first element is the mean (which should have
    name \dQuote{\code{mean}}), and the second element is the variance
    matrix, which should  be a positive definite matrix of the correct
    size, and have name \dQuote{var}}
  \item{D1}{Matrix whose rows are the code run points}
  \item{D2}{Matrix whose rows are field observation points}
  \item{H1}{Regression function for \code{D1}}
  \item{H2}{Regression function for \code{D2}}
  \item{d}{Vector of code outputs and field observations}
  \item{include.prior}{Boolean; passed to function \code{p.eqn8.supp()} (qv)}
  \item{hbar.fun}{Function that gives expectation (with respect to \code{X})
    of \code{h1(x,theta)} and \code{h2(x)} as per section 4.2}
  \item{lower.theta}{Lower integration limit for \code{theta} (NB: a vector)}
  \item{upper.theta}{Lower integration limit for \code{theta} (NB: a
    vector)}
  \item{extractor}{Extractor function; see \code{extractor.toy()} for
    an example}
  \item{give.info}{Boolean, with default \code{FALSE} meaning to return
    just the answer and \code{TRUE} to return the answer along with all
    output from both integrations as performed by \code{adapt()}}
  \item{phi}{Hyperparameters}
  \item{...}{Extra arguments passed to the integration
    function.  If multidimensional (ie \code{length(theta)>1}), then the
    arguments are passed to \code{adapt()}; if one dimensional, they
    are passed to \code{integrate()}}
}
\details{
This function evaluates a numerical approximation to equation 10 of
section 4.2 of the supplement.

Equation 10 integrates over the prior distribution of \code{theta}.  If
\code{theta} is a vector, multidimensional integration is necessary.

In the case of multidimensional integration, the eponymous
\code{adapt()} is used.  Note that, as of version 1.0-3, this is
restricted to fewer than 20 dimensions---which is not checked for.
Evaluation is slow, as multidimensional integration is hard (spot the
understatement).

In the case of one dimensional integration---theta being a
scalar---function \code{integrate()} of the stats package is used.

Note that equation 10 is conditional on the observed data \strong{and}
the hyperparameters
