Description: Performs Bayesian calibration of computer models as per
 Kennedy and O'Hagan 2001.  The package includes routines to find the
 hyperparameters and parameters; see the help page for stage1() for a
 worked example using the toy dataset.  A tutorial is provided in the
 calex.Rnw vignette; and a suite of especially simple one dimensional
 examples appears in inst/doc/one.dim/.
